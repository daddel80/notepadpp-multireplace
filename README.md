## Key Features

-   **Multiple Replacements**: Perform multiple replacements in a single operation, in one document or across all open documents
-   **Save and Load Lists**: Store and load search/replace lists for reuse across different sessions or projects, including all relevant settings.
-   **Selection Support**: Supports rectangular and multiple selections for targeted replacements.
-   **CSV Column Operations**: Search, replace, sort, or highlight specific columns in CSV or other delimited files by selecting column numbers.
-   **Conditional Replacements**: Use variables, conditions, and mathematical operations for complex replacements, fully integrated into the replacement list like regular entries.
-   **Highlight Matches**: Mark multiple search terms in the text, each with a distinct color for easy differentiation.
-   **External Lookups**: Replace matches with values from external hash or lookup files for externalizing large or frequently updated mapping tables.
-   **Bash Script Export**: Export replacement operations as a bash script for use outside of Notepad++.

## Match and Replace Options

**Match Whole Word Only:** When this option is enabled, the search term is matched only if it appears as a whole word. This is particularly useful for avoiding partial matches within larger words, ensuring more precise and targeted search results.

**Match Case:** Selecting this option makes the search case-sensitive, meaning 'Hello' and 'hello' will be treated as distinct terms. It's useful for scenarios where the case of the letters is crucial to the search.

**Use Variables:** This feature allows the use of variables within the replacement string for dynamic and conditional replacements. For more detailed information, refer to the [Option 'Use Variables' chapter](#option-use-variables).

**Replace First Match Only:** For Replace-All operations, this option replaces only the first occurrence of a match for each entry in a Search and Replace list, instead of all matches in the text. This is useful when using different replace strings with the same find pattern. The same effect can be achieved with the 'Use Variables' option using `cond(CNT == 1, 'Replace String')` for conditional replacements.

**Wrap Around:** When this option is active, the search will continue from the beginning of the document after reaching the end, ensuring that no potential matches are missed in the document.

<br>

## Scope Functions
Scope functions define the range for searching and replacing strings:
-   **Selection Option**: Supports Rectangular and Multiselect to focus on specific areas for search or replace.
-   **CSV Option**: Enables targeted search or replacement within specified columns of a delimited file.
    -   `Cols`: Specify the columns for focused operations.
    -   `Delim`: Define the delimiter character.
    -   `Quote`: Delineate areas where characters are not recognized as delimiters.

### CSV Processing Functions

#### Sorting, Deleting, and Copying
- **Sorting Lines in CSV by Columns**: Ascend or descend, combining columns in any prioritized order.
- **Toggle Sort**: Allows users to return columns to their initial unsorted state with just an extra click on the sorting button. This feature is effective even after rows are modified, deleted, or added.
- **Exclude Header Lines from Sorting**: When sorting CSV files with the CSV scope selected, you can exclude a specified number of top lines (usually header rows) from sorting. Configure this behavior using the `HeaderLines` parameter in the INI file. For details, see the [`INI File Settings`](#configuration-settings).
- **Deleting Multiple Columns**: Remove multiple columns at once, cleaning obsolete delimiters.
- **Clipboard Column Copying**: Copy columns with original delimiters to clipboard.

#### Numeric Sorting in CSV
For accurate numeric sorting in CSV files, the following settings and regex patterns can be used:

| Purpose                                   | Find Pattern        | Replace With   | Regex | Use Variables |
|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------|---------------|
| Align Numbers with Leading Zeros (Decimal)     | `\b(\d*)\.(\d{2})`  | `set(string.rep("0",9-string.len(string.format("%.2f", CAP1)))..string.format("%.2f", CAP1))` | Yes   | Yes           |
| Align Numbers with Leading Zeros (Non-decimal) | `\b(\d+)`           | `set(string.rep("0",9-string.len(CAP1))..CAP1)` | Yes   | Yes           |
| Remove Leading Zeros (Decimal)                 | `\b0+(\d*\.\d+)`    | `$1`           | Yes   | No            |
| Remove Leading Zeros (Non-decimal)             | `\b0+(\d*)`         | `$1`           | Yes   | No            |

<br>

## Option 'Use Variables'
Enable the '**Use Variables**' option to enhance replacements with calculations and logic based on the matched text. This feature lets you create dynamic replacement patterns, handle conditions, and produce flexible outputs—all configured directly in the Replace field. This functionality relies on the [Lua engine](https://www.lua.org/).

---

### Quick Start: Use Variables

1. **Enable "Use Variables"**  
   Check the "**Use Variables**" option in the Replace interface.  

2. **Use a Command**  

   **Option 1:** [`set(...)`](#setstrorcalc) → Directly replaces with a value or calculation.  
   - **Find**: `(\d+)`  
   - **Replace**: `set(CAP1 * 2)`  
   - **Result**: Doubles numbers (e.g., `50` → `100`).  
   *(Enable "Regular Expression" in 'Search Mode' to use `(\d+)` as a capture group.)*  

   **Option 2:** [`cond(...)`](#condcondition-trueval-falseval) → Conditional replacement.  
   - **Find**: `word`  
   - **Replace**: `cond(CNT==1, "FirstWord")`  
   - **Result**: Changes only the **first** occurrence of "word" to "FirstWord".
    
3. **Use Basic Variables:**  
   - **`CNT`**: Inserts the current match number (e.g., "1" for the first match, "2" for the second).
   - **`CAP1`**, **`CAP2`**, etc.: Holds captured groups when Regex is enabled.  
     > **Capture Groups:**  
     > With a regex in parentheses `(...)`, matched text is stored in `CAP` variables (e.g., `(\d+)` in `Item 123` stores `123` in `CAP1`).  For more details, refer to regex documentation.

   See the [Variables Overview](#variables-overview) for a complete list.

### Variables Overview
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **CNT**  | Count of the detected string. |
| **LINE** | Line number where the string is found. |
| **APOS** | Absolute character position in the document. |
| **LPOS** | Relative line position. |
| **LCNT** | Count of the detected string within the line. |
| **COL**  | Column number where the string was found (CSV-Scope option selected).|
| **MATCH**| Contains the text of the detected string, in contrast to `CAP` variables which correspond to capture groups in regex patterns. |
| **FNAME**| Filename or window title for new, unsaved files. |
| **FPATH**| Full path including the filename, or empty for new, unsaved files. |
| **CAP1**, **CAP2**, ...  | These variables are equivalents to regex capture groups, designed for use in the 'Use Variables' environment. They are specifically suited for calculations and conditional operations within this environment. Although their counterparts ($1, $2, ...) cannot be used here.|

**Decimal Separator**<br>
When `MATCH` and `CAP` variables are used to read numerical values for further calculations, both dot (.) and comma (,) can serve as decimal separators. However, these variables do not support the use of thousands separators.

<br>

### Command Overview
#### String Composition
`..` is employed for concatenation.  
E.g., `"Detected "..CNT.." times."`

<br>

#### set(strOrCalc)
Directly outputs strings or numbers, replacing the matched text with a specified or calculated value.

| Find      | Replace with                            | Regex | Description/Expected Output                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `apple`   | `set("banana")`                         | No    | Replaces every occurrence of `apple` with the string `"banana"`.           |
| `(\d+)`   | `set(CAP1 * 2)`                         | Yes   | Doubles any found number; e.g., `10` becomes `20`.                         |
| `found`   | `set("Found #"..CNT.." at position "..APOS)` | No    | Shows how many times `found` was detected and its absolute position.       |

<br>

#### cond(condition, trueVal, [falseVal])
Evaluates the condition and outputs `trueVal` if the condition is true, otherwise `falseVal`. If `falseVal` is omitted, the original text remains unchanged when the condition is false.

| Find        | Replace with                                                                          | Regex | Description/Expected Output                                                                                             |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `word`      | `cond(CNT==1, "First 'word'", "Another 'word'")`                                      | No    | For the first occurrence of `word` → `"First 'word'"`; for subsequent matches → `"Another 'word'"`.                    |
| `(\d+)`     | `cond(CAP1>100, "Large number", cond(CAP1>50, "Medium number", "Small number"))`      | Yes   | For a numeric match: if > 100 → `"Large number"`, if > 50 → `"Medium number"`, otherwise → `"Small number"`.           |
| `anymatch`  | `cond(APOS<50, "Early in document", "Later in document")`                             | No    | If the absolute position `APOS` is under 50 → `"Early in document"`, otherwise → `"Later in document"`.                |

<br>

#### **vars({Variable1=Value1, Variable2=Value2, ...})**
**Note:** This command was previously named `init(...)` and has been renamed to `vars(...)`. For compatibility, `init(...)` still works.

Initializes custom variables for use in various commands, extending beyond standard variables like `CNT`, `MATCH`, `CAP1`. These variables can carry the status of previous find-and-replace operations to subsequent ones.

Custom variables maintain their values throughout a single Replace-All or within a list of multiple Replace operations. Thus, they can transfer values from one list entry to subsequent ones. They reset at the start of each new document in **'Replace All in All Open Documents'**.

| **Find**        | **Replace**                                                                                                                            | **Before**                                     | **After**                                              | **Regex** | **Scope CSV** | **Description**                                                                                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `(\d+)`         | `vars({COL2=0,COL4=0}); cond(LCNT==4, COL2+COL4);`<br>`if COL==2 then COL2=CAP1 end;`<br>`if COL==4 then COL4=CAP1 end;`               | `1,20,text,2,0`<br>`2,30,text,3,0`<br>`3,40,text,4,0` | `1,20,text,2,22.0`<br>`2,30,text,3,33.0`<br>`3,40,text,4,44.0` | Yes      | Yes          | Tracks values from columns 2 and 4, sums them, and updates the result for the 4th match in the current line.                |
| `\d{2}-[A-Z]{3}`| `vars({MATCH_PREV=''}); cond(LCNT==1,'Moved', MATCH_PREV); MATCH_PREV=MATCH;`                                                           | `12-POV,00-PLC`<br>`65-SUB,00-PLC`<br>`43-VOL,00-PLC`  | `Moved,12-POV`<br>`Moved,65-SUB`<br>`Moved,43-VOL`      | Yes      | No           | Uses `MATCH_PREV` to track the first match in the line and shift it to the 2nd (`LCNT`) match during replacements.           |

An empty Find string (`*(empty)*`) can be used to set variables for the entire Find and Replace list without being tied to a specific Find action. This entry does **not** match any text but is executed once at the beginning of the **'Replace'** or **'Replace All'** process when **'Use List'** is enabled. It allows the Replace field to run initialization commands like `vars()` for the entire operation. This entry is always executed first, regardless of its position in the list.

| **Find**           | **Replace**                                                                                                             | **Description/Expected Output**                                                                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *(empty)*          | `vars({ `<br>`VpersonName = FNAME:sub(1, (FNAME:find(" - ", 1, true) or 0) - 1),`<br>`Vdepartment = FNAME:sub((FNAME:find(" - ", 1, true) or #FNAME + 1) + 3, (FNAME:find(".", 1, true) or 0) - 1) })` | Extracts `VpersonName` and `Vdepartment` from the active document’s filename in the format `<Name> - <Department>.xml` using the `vars` action. Triggered only once at the start of the replace process when **Find** is empty. |
| `personname`       | `set(VpersonName)`                                                                                                       | Replaces `personname` with the content of the variable `VpersonName`, previously initialized by the `vars` action.                     |
| `department`       | `set(Vdepartment)`                                                                                                       | Replaces `department` with the content of the variable `Vdepartment`, previously initialized by the `vars` action.                     |

<br>

#### **lvars(filePath)**

Loads custom variables from an external file. The file specifies variable names and their corresponding values. The loaded variables can then be used throughout the Replace process, similar to how variables defined with [`vars`](#varsvariable1value1-variable2value2-) work.

The parameter **filePath** must specify a valid path to a file. Supported path formats include:
- Escaped Backslashes: `"C:\\path\\to\\file.vars"`
- Forward Slashes: `"C:/path/to/file.vars"`
- Long Bracket String: `[[C:\path\to\file.vars]]`

**Example File:**
```lua
-- Local variables remain private
local PATH = [[C:\Data\Projects\Example\]]

-- Only the returned variables are accessible in Replace operations
return {
    userName = "Alice",
    threshold = 10,
    enableFeature = true,
    fullPath = PATH .. "dataFile.lkp" -- Combine a local variable with a string
}
```

| Find          | Replace                                                                       | Regex | Scope CSV | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *(empty)*     | `lvars([[C:\tmp\m\Vars.vars]])`                                              | No    | No        | Loads variables such as `userName = "Alice"` and `threshold = 10` from `myVars.vars`.               |
| `Hello`       | `set(userName)`                                                              | No    | No        | Replaces `Hello` with the value of the variable `userName`, e.g., `"Alice"`.                        |
| `(\d+)`       | `cond(threshold > 5, "Above", "Below")`                                      | Yes   | No        | Replaces the match based on the condition evaluated using the variable `threshold`.                 |

**Key Points**
- **Initialization**: An empty Find string (*(empty)*) initializes variables globally at the start of the Replace or Replace All process when "Use List" is enabled. This initialization occurs only once, regardless of its position in the list.
- **Conditional Loading**: Variables can be loaded conditionally by placing lvars(filePath) alongside a specific Find pattern. In this case, the variables are only initialized when the pattern matches.
- **Local vs. Returned Variables**: Only variables explicitly included in the return table of the .vars file are available for use. Any local variables remain private to the file.

<br>

#### **lkp(key, hpath, inner)**
Performs an external lookup of **key** against an indexed data file located at **hpath** and returns the corresponding value. By default, if the **key** is not found, `lkp()` simply reverts to the key itself. Setting **inner** to `true` instead yields a `nil` result when the key is missing, allowing for conditional checks or deeper nested logic.

##### Key and File Path
- **Key**:  
  The **key** can be either a string or a number. Numbers are automatically converted to strings to ensure compatibility in the lookup process.
  
- **File Path (hpath)**:  
  The **hpath** must point to a valid `.lkp` file that returns a table of data.

  **Supported Path Formats**:  
  - Escaped Backslashes: `"C:\\path\\to\\file.lkp"`  
  - Forward Slashes: `"C:/path/to/file.lkp"`  
  - Long Bracket String: `[[C:\path\to\file.lkp]]`  

##### Data File Format
Each lkp file must be defined as a table of entries in the form `{ [keys], value }`, where `[keys]` can be:
- A single key (e.g., `"001"`).  
- An array of keys (e.g., `{ "001", "1", 1 }`) mapping to the same value.

**Example**:
```lua
return {
    { {"001", "1", 1}, "One" },
    { 2, "Two" },
    { "003", "Three" }
}
```

In this example:
- `'001'`, `'1'`, and `1` all correspond to `"One"`.  
- `2` corresponds to `"Two"`.  
- `'003'` directly maps to `"Three"`.   

##### Caching Mechanism
Once `lkp()` loads the data file for **hpath**, the parsed table is cached in memory for the duration of the Replace-All operation.

##### inner Flag
- **`false` (default, can be omitted)**: If the key is not found, `lkp()` returns the **search term itself** (e.g., `MATCH`, `CAP1`), instead of a mapped value.
- **`true`**: If the key is not found, `lkp()` returns `nil`, allowing conditional handling.

##### Examples

| **Find**   | **Replace**                                                                                               | **Regex** | **Scope CSV** | **Description**                                                                                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `\b\w+\b`  | `lkp(MATCH, [[C:\tmp\hash.lkp]], true)`                                                                    | Yes       | No            | Uses **inner = true**: If a match is found in the lookup file, replaces it with the mapped value. If no match is found, the original word is removed. |
| `(\d+)`    | `lkp(CAP1, "C:/path/to/myLookupFile.lkp")`                                                                | Yes       | No            | Uses **inner = false** (default): If a match is found in the lookup file, replaces it with the mapped value. If no match is found, the original text (`CAP1`) is returned. |
| `\b\w+\b`  | `output = lkp(MATCH, [[C:\tmp\hash.lkp]], true).result; set(output or "NoKey")`                           | Yes       | No            | Uses **inner = true**: If the lookup result is non-`nil`, replaces with the mapped value. Otherwise, replaces with `"NoKey"`. |
| `\b\w+\b`  | `cond(COL==3, lkp(MATCH, [[C:/tmp/col3_hash.lkp]]))`                                               | No        | Yes           | Looks up values in the third column (`COL==3`) using a separate lookup file (`col3_hash.lkp`). If a match is found, replaces it; otherwise, leaves it unchanged. |

#### **fmtN(num, maxDecimals, fixedDecimals)**
Formats numbers based on precision (maxDecimals) and whether the number of decimals is fixed (fixedDecimals being true or false).

**Note**: The `fmtN` command can exclusively be used within the `set` and `cond` commands.
| Example                             | Result  |
|-------------------------------------|---------|
| `set(fmtN(5.73652, 2, true))`       | "5.74"  |
| `set(fmtN(5.0, 2, true))`           | "5.00"  |
| `set(fmtN(5.73652, 4, false))`      | "5.7365"|
| `set(fmtN(5.0, 4, false))`          | "5"     |

### Operators 
| Type        | Operators                     |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Arithmetic  | `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `%`  |
| Relational  | `==`, `~=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`|
| Logical     | `and`, `or`, `not`            |

<br>

### If-Then Logic
If-then logic is integral for dynamic replacements, allowing users to set custom variables based on specific conditions. This enhances the versatility of find-and-replace operations.

**Note**: Do not embed `cond()`, `set()`, or `vars()` within if statements; if statements are exclusively for adjusting custom variables.

##### Syntax Combinations
- `if condition then ... end`
- `if condition then ... else ... end`
- `if condition then ... elseif another_condition then ... end`
- `if condition then ... elseif another_condition then ... else ... end`

##### Example
This example shows how to use `if` statements with `cond()` to manage variables based on conditions:

`vars({MVAR=""}); if CAP2~=nil then MVAR=MVAR..CAP2 end; cond(string.sub(CAP1,1,1)~="#", MVAR); if CAP2~=nil then MVAR=string.sub(CAP1,4,-1) end`

<br>

### DEBUG option

The `DEBUG` option lets you inspect global variables during replacements. When enabled, it opens a message box displaying the current values of all global variables for each replacement hit, requiring confirmation to proceed to the next match. Initialize the `DEBUG` option in your replacement string to enable it.

| Find      | Replace                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `(\d+)`    | `vars({DEBUG=true}); set("Number: "..CAP1)`|

|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `;`              | `cond(LCNT==5,";Column5;")`                                                                               | No    | No        | Adds a 5th Column for each line into a `;` delimited file.                                      |
| `key`            | `set("key"..CNT)`                                                                                         | No    | No        | Enumerates key values by appending the count of detected strings. E.g., key1, key2, key3, etc.  |
| `(\d+)`          | `set(CAP1.."€ The VAT is: ".. (CAP1 * 0.15).."€ Total with VAT: ".. (CAP1 + (CAP1 * 0.15)).."€")`          | Yes   | No        | Finds a number and calculates the VAT at 15%, then displays the original amount, the VAT, and the total amount. E.g., `50` becomes `50€ The VAT is: 7.5€ Total with VAT: 57.5€`. |
| `---`            | `cond(COL==1 and LINE<3, "0-2", cond(COL==2 and LINE>2 and LINE<5, "3-4", cond(COL==3 and LINE>=5 and LINE<10, "5-9", cond(COL==4 and LINE>=10, "10+"))))` | No    | Yes       | Replaces `---` with a specific range based on the `COL` and `LINE` values. E.g., `3-4` in column 2 of lines 3-4, and `5-9` in column 3 of lines 5-9 assuming `---` is found in all lines and columns. |
| `(\d+)\.(\d+)\.(\d+)` | `cond(CAP1 > 0 and CAP2 == 0 and CAP3 == 0, MATCH, cond(CAP2 > 0 and CAP3 == 0, " " .. MATCH, " " .. MATCH))` | Yes   | No        | Alters the spacing based on the hierarchy of the version numbers, aligning lower hierarchies with spaces as needed. E.g., `1.0.0` remains `1.0.0`, `1.2.0` becomes ` 1.2.0`, indicating a second-level version change. |
| `(\d+)`          | `set(CAP1 * 2)`                                                                                           | Yes   | No        | Doubles the matched number. E.g., `100` becomes `200`.                                          |
| `;`              | `cond(LCNT == 1, string.rep(" ", 20- (LPOS))..";")`                                                       | No    | No        | Inserts spaces before the semicolon to align it to the 20th character position if it's the first occurrence. |
| `-`              | `cond(LINE == math.floor(10.5 + 6.25 * math.sin((2 * math.pi * LPOS) / 50)), "*", " ")`                    | No    | No        | Draws a sine wave across a canvas of '-' characters spanning at least 20 lines and 80 characters per line. |

- **Double-Click**: Double-clicking on a list entry allows direct in-place editing. This behavior can be adjusted via the [`DoubleClickEdits`](#configuration-settings) parameter.

### List Columns
- **Find**: The text or pattern to search for.
- **Replace**: The text or pattern to replace with.
- **Options Columns**:
  - **W**: Match whole word only.
  - **C**: Match case.
  - **V**: Use Variables.
  - **N**: Normal search mode.
  - **E**: Extended search mode.
  - **R**: Regular expression mode.
- **Additional Columns**:
  - **Find Count**: Displays the number of times each 'Find what' string is detected.
  - **Replace Count**: Shows the number of replacements made for each 'Replace with' string.
  - **Comments**: Add custom comments to entries for annotations or additional context.
  - **Delete**: Contains a delete button for each entry, allowing quick removal from the list.

You can manage the visibility of the additional columns via the **Header Column Menu** by right-clicking on the header row.

## Data Handling

### Import/Export
-   Supports import/export of search and replace strings with their options in CSV format, including selection states.
-   Allows loading list files via drag and drop into the Search and Replace list.
-   Adherence to RFC 4180 standards for CSV, enabling compatibility and easy interaction with other CSV handling tools.
-   Enables reuse of search and replace operations across sessions and projects.

### Bash Script Export
- Exports Find and Replace strings into a runnable script, aiming to encapsulate the full functionality of the plugin in the script. However, due to differences in tooling, complete compatibility cannot be guaranteed.
- Entries flagged with "Use Variables" are skipped as they are not supported in the exported script.
- This feature intentionally does not support the value `\0` in the Extended Option to avoid escalating environment tooling requirements.

## UI and Behavior Settings

### Column Locking

Lock column widths to prevent resizing during window adjustments. This is useful for key columns like **Find**, **Replace**, and **Comments**.
- **How to Lock**: Double-click the column divider in the header to toggle locking. A lock icon appears in the header for locked columns.
- **Effect**: Locked columns keep their width fixed, while unlocked ones adjust dynamically.

### Configuration Settings

The MultiReplace plugin provides several configuration options, including transparency, scaling, and behavior settings, that can be adjusted via the INI file located at:
`C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Notepad++\plugins\Config\MultiReplace.ini`

#### INI File Settings:

- **HeaderLines**: Specifies the number of top lines to exclude from sorting as headers.
  - **Default**: `HeaderLines=1` (first line is excluded from sorting).
  - **Description**: Set this value to exclude a specific number of lines at the top of the file from being sorted during CSV operations. Useful for preserving header rows in CSV files.
  - **Note**: If set to `0`, no lines are excluded from sorting.

- **Transparency Settings**:
  - `ForegroundTransparency`: Transparency level when in focus (0-255, default 255).
  - `BackgroundTransparency`: Transparency level when not in focus (0-255, default 190).

- **ScaleFactor**: Controls the scaling of the plugin window and UI elements.
  - **Default**: `ScaleFactor=1.0` (normal size).
  - **Range**: 0.5 to 2.0.
  - **Description**: Adjust this value to resize the plugin window and UI elements. A lower value shrinks the interface, while a higher value enlarges it.

- **DoubleClickEdits**: Controls the behavior of double-clicking on list entries.
  - **Default**: `DoubleClickEdits=1` (enabled).
  - **Description**: When enabled (`1`), double-clicking on a list entry allows direct in-place editing. When disabled (`0`), double-clicking transfers the entry to the input fields for editing.

- **HoverText**: Enables or disables the display of full text for truncated list entries when hovering over them.
  - **Default**: `HoverText=1` (enabled).
  - **Description**: When enabled (`1`), hovering over a truncated entry shows its full content in a pop-up. Set to `0` to disable this functionality.

- **Tooltips**: Controls the display of tooltips in the UI.
  - **Default**: `Tooltips=1` (enabled).
  - **Description**: To disable tooltips, set `Tooltips=0` in the INI file.

- **AlertNotFound**: Controls notifications for unsuccessful searches.
  - **Default**: `AlertNotFound=1` (enabled).
  - **Description**: To disable the bell sound for unsuccessful searches, set `AlertNotFound=0` in the INI file.
 
- **EditFieldSize**: Configures the size adjustment of the edit field in the list during toggling.
  - **Default**: `editFieldSize=5` (normal size).
  - **Range**: 2 to 20.
  - **Description**: Sets the factor by which the edit field in the list expands or collapses when toggling its size.

### Multilingual UI Support

The UI language settings for the MultiReplace plugin can be customized by adjusting the `languages.ini` file located in `C:\Program Files\Notepad++\plugins\MultiReplace\`. These adjustments will ensure that the selected language in Notepad++ is applied within the plugin. 

Contributions to the `languages.ini` file on GitHub are welcome for future versions. Find the file [here](https://github.com/daddel80/notepadpp-multireplace/blob/main/languages.ini).
